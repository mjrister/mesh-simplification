# Mesh Simplification

In computer graphics, performance is often directly correlated to the complexity of the scene. One technique for dealing with performance bottlenecks is to simplify a polygon mesh by reducing the number of triangles that compose it. This project presents an efficient algorithm to achieve this, first described by Garland-Heckbert in a seminal research paper entitled [Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics](https://github.com/matthew-rister/mesh_simplification/blob/main/MeshSimplification/docs/surface_simplification.pdf). 

The core idea of the algorithm is to collapse an edge into a single vertex that preserves the original shape of the mesh. This vertex position can be solved for analytically by minimizing the squared distance from a triangle's plane to its new position after the edge has been collapsed. With this error metric, edges can be efficiently processed using a priority queue to iteratively remove edges with the lowest cost until the mesh has been sufficiently simplified. To facilitate the implementation of this algorithm, a data structure known as a [half-edge mesh](https://github.com/matthew-rister/mesh_simplification/blob/main/MeshSimplification/geometry/half_edge_mesh.h) is employed to efficiently traverse and modify edges in the mesh.

The following GIF presents a real-time demonstration of successive applications of mesh simplification on a polygon mesh consisting of nearly 70,000 triangles. At each iteration, the number of triangles is reduced by 50% eventually reducing to a mesh consisting of only 1,086 triangles (98.5% reduction). Observe that although fidelity is reduced, the mesh retains an overall high-quality appearance that nicely approximates the original shape the mesh.

## How To Run
This project was implemented using Visual Studio in C++20 and OpenGL 4.6. To build it, you will need a version of Visual Studio that supports the latest language standard (e.g., 16.10.0). Additionally, this project uses [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) to manage 3rd party dependencies. To get started, clone the [vcpkg repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) on Github and run `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` followed by `vcpkg integrate install`. Upon completion, you should be able to build and run the project which will install dependencies from the [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/matthew-rister/mesh_simplification/blob/main/vcpkg.json) package manifest on first build. _At this time, only x64 architecture is supported._

Once the program is running, you can rotate the mesh about an arbitrary axis by dragging the cursor across the screen (implemented using an [arcball interface](https://github.com/matthew-rister/mesh_simplification/blob/main/MeshSimplification/docs/arcball.pdf)) in addition to translating the mesh using the `W,A,X,D` keys. The mesh can also be uniformly scaled using the `+,-` keys. Finally, to simplify the mesh, press the `S` key.
